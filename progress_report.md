# Final Project Progress Report
## Due: November 27, 2019

#### Team members:
#### Shane Andrade, Sam Tosaria, Apik Zorian, Daniel Alvarez

## 1) What you have done so far?

#### Shane Andrade:
- Performed EDA on dataset
- Created basic visualizations of categorical data
- Converted test and training data to parquet format
- Experimenting with decision trees in SparkML, currently running into memory issues and will continue to investigate
- Will perform feature engineering on a subset of the categorical columns


#### Sam Tosaria:



#### Apik Zorian:
- Performed exploratory data analysis on random sample of training data. Identified expendable features and developed feature transformation method for categorical features in pandas.
- Succesfully converted dataset to parquet file
- Working on feature transformation using SparkQL file
- Working on modeling distributed Logistic Regression model using MapReduce


#### Daniel Alvarez:
- Uploaded raw files to GCP bucket.
- Performed preliminary exploratory data analysis on a representative random sample of the train data (.1% of the `train.txt`) locally.
- Compared exploratory data analysis to group members to assess consistency of results and plan for feature engineering.


##  2) What you will be doing for the rest of the project?


#### Shane Andrade:



#### Sam Tosaria:



#### Apik Zorian:



#### Daniel Alvarez:
- Discuss challenges based on the EDA.
- Perform feature engineering on a subset of the categorical columns.
